# Overview

Welcome to the workshop! The aim is to help you understand how some ideas from traditional functional programming languages (like Haskell) can apply to writing JavaScript and (perhaps most importantly) how you can leverage these techniques to build production ready node.js applications.

While the focus for the workshop is mainly on node.js, a lot of what is covered can be applied to working in the browser too.

## Development environment

We're going to be making use of some fairly new language features so to get the most out of the workshop you'll need to have node > v9 (preferably v10), npm 5+ and the latest version of yarn installed. Yarn isn't an absolute necessity but it's what has been used to build out the workshop examples so it may help to be consistent.
